This is a very simple Chrome or Chromium extension to keep Facebook posts in
"most recent" order. Default Facebook behavior is to ignore your "Newsfeed"
preference when you click the [f] icon on the top left of the page, and return
you to "top posts". This sets the [f] icon to return posts in "most recent"
order by changing the querystring from `?ref=logo` to `?sk=h_chr`.

To install the extension:
   1. `git clone` this repository
   2. Open a new tab and visit <chrome://extensions>
   3. At the top right, slide the Developer Mode button to the right if it isn't already there.
   4. At the left, click [Load unpacked] and navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
